# Gibbs-Privacy-for-Federated-Learning

This repository contains the jupyter notebook code to reproduce the simulations and the graph disclosed in the paper "Gibbs Privacy for Federated Learning". 

To do so, you first have to download the requirement packages written in the "requirements.txt" file by running the following line. 

```
python extract_and_install_packages.py
```



Then you can open "AI4STATS_2024.ipynb" file and run the cells one-by-one. You may want to change the number of simulations or play with the number of iterations. It is up to you.
